EEPROM - electrically erasable programmable read-only memory
	-but not really read-only, can write to it

RX<-0 = receive
TX->1 = transmit

quartz crystal oscillator - ticks 16 million times/second, one mathematical operation each tick

Ohm's Law
	I = V/R
		current = voltage/resistance
			A = V/Ω
				amperes = voltage/ohms
	mA = .001 amperes (1/1000)

P = I*V
	watts = amps*voltage
P = (V^2)/R
	watts = volts^2/resistance



Computer Systems

	5 functional units
		
		control unit (CU)
			fetching, decoding, executing
		arithmetic logical unit (ALU)
		main memory
			typically RAM
		secondary storage
			typically ROM
		I/O

		CPU = CU+ALU


	CISC	-	complex instruction set computer
		simple to complex
	RISC	-	reduced instruction set computer
		very simple

	Von Neumann Architecture
		aka Princeton Architecture aka Stored Program Computer
			-instructions and data stored in same physical memory

	Harvard Architecture
		-instructions and data stored separately
		AVR uses Harvard architecture
		



		


Digital Logic

	Logic Gates
		Pins ordered counter-clockwise from notch
			Pin 7 - often GND
			Pin 14 - often 5v

	TTL - transistor-transistor logic

	Current and Voltage Limitations
		7400 series gate:
			I OH = maximum current when output is high. About -0.4mA for TTL
			I OL = maximum current when output is low. About 16.0mA
			I IH = maximum current when input is high. About 0.04mA
			I IL = maximum current when input is low. About -1.6mA

		For signals ENTERING TTL gate:
			2v to 5v = HIGH
			0v to 0.8v = LOW
			Else unknown

		For signals EXITING TTL gate:
			2.4v to 5v = HIGH
			0v to 0.4v = LOW
			Else unknown


	Fan Out - Number of gate inputs that can be driven by one chip output before output signal degrades.
		-determined by output current and input current

			I OH = maximum current when output is high. About –0.40mA for TTL
			I OL = maximum current when output is low. About 16.00mA
			I IH = maximum current when input is high. About 0.04mA
			I IL = maximum current when input is low. About –1.60mA


	DIP and SIP resistors - p24
		dual in-line-package
			471 = "47"+1*("0") = 471 ohms
			102 = "10"+2*("0") = 1000 ohms
		single in-line-package
			-number of resistors is 1 less than number of pins in SIP

	The three most important hardware registers		Make: AVR Programming p48
		DDRx data-direction registers (portx)
		PORTx port x data registers
		PINx port x input pins address

		Configuring output: DDRs, PORTs
			1. Configure the relevant pin for output mode by writing to the data-direction register (DDR).
			2. Assign a high or low value to the individual pin by writing to the PORT hardware register.


	Set a bit
		BYTE |= 1<< i;

	Clear a bit
		BYTE &= ~(1 << i);

	Toggle a bit
		BYTE ^= 1 << i;
